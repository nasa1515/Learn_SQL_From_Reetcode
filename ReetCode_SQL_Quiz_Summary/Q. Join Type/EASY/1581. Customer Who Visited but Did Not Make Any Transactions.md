## [1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions] 

### Table: Visits


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |

visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.  
This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.  
 

### Table: Transactions


| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |

transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.  
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.  

## Problem 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.  
Return the result table sorted in any order.  
The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Visits


| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

Transactions

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

### Output: 

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

### Explanation: 
* Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.  
* Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.  
* Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.  
* Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.  
* Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.  
* As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT V.customer_id, count(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits V
LEFT JOIN Transactions T
ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id 
WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id 
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`LEFT JOIN` 을 사용해서, 조회되지 않아 `NULL` 처리된 데이터를 계산하는 문제였습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다.   

1. `Transactions` Table에 존재하지 않는 `visit_id`를 찾아서, 그 갯수를 세는 로직 입니다. -> `(LEFT JOIN Transactions T)`       
`IS NULL` LEFT JOIN 이후 Join Key가 존재하지 않는 오른쪽 테이블의 데이터는 NULL 처리되는데, `Null` 처리된 데이터의 갯수만 세면 완료입니다.
