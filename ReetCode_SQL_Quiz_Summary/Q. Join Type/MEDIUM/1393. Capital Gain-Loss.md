## [1393. Capital Gain/Loss]  

### Table : Stocks


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |

(stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this Table.  
The operation column is an ENUM (category) of type ('Sell', 'Buy')  
Each row of this | indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.  
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day.   
It is also guaranteed that each   'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.  
 
## Problem 

Write a solution to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.  

The Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.  

Return the result | in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Stocks Table:


| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |
| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |

### Output: 

| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |

### Explanation: 
* Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
* Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
* Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. 
* At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. 
* Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) | (500 - 1000) | (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 | 9000 = 9500$.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT stock_name, SUM((sell_price - buy_price)) as capital_gain_loss
FROM (
    SELECT S1.stock_name, S2.price as sell_price, S1.price as buy_price       
    FROM Stocks S1
    JOIN Stocks S2
    ON S1.stock_name = S2.stock_name AND S1.Operation != S2.Operation AND S1.operation_day <= S2.operation_day
    WHERE S1.operation = "Buy"
    GROUP BY S1.stock_name, S1.operation_day) AS temp
GROUP BY stock_name
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`INNER JOIN`을 사용해 `Buy - Sell` 조건에 맞는 데이터를 필터링 및 집계해 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `INNER JOIN`의 조건을 아래 세개로 구분지어서, `BUY-SELL` 데이터를 매칭 시켰습니다. 
    * stock_name 이 동일한 것. (동일한 주식이어야 하는 근거)
    * Operation은 다른 것 (샀는지, 팔았는지 구분을 위한 근거)
    * operation_day이 더 큰 것 (산 뒤엔 무조건 팔았음을 위한 근거)    

#### INNER JOIN SQL

```sql
SELECT S1.stock_name, S2.price as sell_price, S1.price as buy_price       
FROM Stocks S1
JOIN Stocks S2
ON S1.stock_name = S2.stock_name AND S1.Operation != S2.Operation AND S1.operation_day <= S2.operation_day
```

#### INNER JOIN SQL 결과

| stock_name   | operation | operation_day | price | stock_name   | operation | operation_day | price |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Leetcode     | Buy       | 1             | 1000  | Leetcode     | Sell      | 5             | 9000  |
| Corona Masks | Buy       | 2             | 10    | Corona Masks | Sell      | 3             | 1010  |
| Corona Masks | Sell      | 3             | 1010  | Corona Masks | Buy       | 4             | 1000  |
| Corona Masks | Buy       | 4             | 1000  | Corona Masks | Sell      | 5             | 500   |
| Corona Masks | Buy       | 2             | 10    | Corona Masks | Sell      | 5             | 500   |
| Corona Masks | Sell      | 5             | 500   | Corona Masks | Buy       | 6             | 1000  |
| Corona Masks | Sell      | 3             | 1010  | Corona Masks | Buy       | 6             | 1000  |
| Handbags     | Buy       | 17            | 30000 | Handbags   ...

위 처럼, Buy에는 Sell이 붙는 식으로 처리 됩니다.  
이후 `WHERE S1.operation = "Buy"` 으로 Buy 인 데이터만 걸러내고, `GROUP BY S1.stock_name, S1.operation_day`로 `SELF JOIN`으로 중복된 컬럼들을 제거해준 뒤 계산하면 정답입니다.  


### ➕ 추가 솔루션

```sql
SELECT stock_name, SUM(
    CASE
        WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
        ELSE price
    END
) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```
가만히 고민하다 보니, 굳이 `SELF JOIN`이 아니라, `Operation` 컬럼의 값을 `IF OR CASE` 문으로 구분 지어서 계산할 수도 있었습니다.
