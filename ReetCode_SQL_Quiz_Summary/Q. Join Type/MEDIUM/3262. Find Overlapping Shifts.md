## [3262. Find Overlapping Shifts]  


### Table: EmployeeShifts


| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| employee_id      | int     |
| start_time       | time    |
| end_time         | time    |

(employee_id, start_time) is the unique key for this table.  
This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start and end times on a specific date.  
Write a solution to count the number of overlapping shifts for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if one shift’s end_time is later than another shift’s start_time.  


## Problem

Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.  

The query result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example:

### Input:

EmployeeShifts table:


| employee_id | start_time | end_time |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| 1           | 08:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 1           | 11:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 1           | 14:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 2           | 09:00:00   | 17:00:00 |
| 2           | 16:00:00   | 20:00:00 |
| 3           | 10:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 3           | 13:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 3           | 16:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 4           | 08:00:00   | 10:00:00 |
| 4           | 09:00:00   | 11:00:00 |

### Output:


| employee_id | overlapping_shifts |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 1           | 2                  |
| 2           | 1                  |
| 4           | 1                  |

### Explanation:

* Employee 1 has 3 shifts:
    * 08:00:00 to 12:00:00
    * 11:00:00 to 15:00:00
    * 14:00:00 to 18:00:00
    * The first shift overlaps with the second, and the second overlaps with the third, resulting in 2 overlapping shifts.

* Employee 2 has 2 shifts:
    * 09:00:00 to 17:00:00
    * 16:00:00 to 20:00:00
    * These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.

* Employee 3 has 3 shifts:
    * 10:00:00 to 12:00:00
    * 13:00:00 to 15:00:00
    * 16:00:00 to 18:00:00
    * None of these shifts overlap, so Employee 3 is not included in the output.

* Employee 4 has 2 shifts:
    * 08:00:00 to 10:00:00
    * 09:00:00 to 11:00:00
    * These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.

* The output shows the employee_id and the count of overlapping shifts for each employee who has at least one overlapping shift, ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id,
       COUNT(*) AS overlapping_shifts
FROM EmployeeShifts e1 JOIN EmployeeShifts e2
ON e1.employee_id=e2.employee_id
WHERE e1.start_time < e2.start_time AND e1.end_time > e2.start_time
GROUP BY e1.employee_id
ORDER BY employee_id
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

알고리즘을 떠올리기 굉장히 힘들었지만, 문제에 집중하면 특정 패턴이 보였습니다.  
문제에서 도출되는 힌트들을 종합하면 아래와 같은 조건들을 정리할 수 있습니다.  

* 문제는 `EmployeeShifts`테이블에서, `start_time`이 다음 행의 `end_time` 보다 작은 경우를 Counting하여 출력하는 문제입니다.  
* 출력의 결과를 보면 아래와 같은 패턴이존재합니다.  
    * `LAG()` 으로 해결할 수도, `Self Join`으로 해결할 수 있습니다. (저는 `Self_JOIN`)  
    * 결국 E1, E2와 같은 SELF JOIN 테이블에서 후행 테이블이 조건을, 동일한 `employee_id`를 기준으로 조회하면 정답입니다.


#### STEP. 1 [SELF JOIN - Groupby - count()]  

```
SELECT e1.employee_id,
       COUNT(*) AS overlapping_shifts
FROM EmployeeShifts e1 JOIN EmployeeShifts e2
ON e1.employee_id=e2.employee_id
WHERE e1.start_time < e2.start_time AND e1.end_time > e2.start_time
GROUP BY e1.employee_id
ORDER BY employee_id
```

이번 문제는, 따로 구분된 STEP으로 나눌 필요가 없이, `Self join` 후 집계에 대한 결과만 출력하면 됩니다.  

* `e1.start_time < e2.start_time AND e1.end_time > e2.start_time` - where로 다음 start_time을 필터링 및 다음 end_time 보다 적은 경우.
