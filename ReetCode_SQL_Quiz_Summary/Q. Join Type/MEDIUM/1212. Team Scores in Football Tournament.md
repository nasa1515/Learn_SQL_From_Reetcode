## [1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament]

### Table: Teams


| Column Name   | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |

team_id is the column with unique values of this table.  
Each row of this table represents a single football team.  
 

### Table: Matches


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |

match_id is the column of unique values of this table.  
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams.   
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively.  
 
## Problem 

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:  
* A team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).
* A team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
* A team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).

Write a solution that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches.  

Return the result table ordered by num_points in decreasing order. In case of a tie, order the records by team_id in increasing order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Teams table:

| team_id   | team_name    |
|-----------|--------------|
| 10        | Leetcode FC  |
| 20        | NewYork FC   |
| 30        | Atlanta FC   |
| 40        | Chicago FC   |
| 50        | Toronto FC   |

Matches table:

| match_id   | host_team    | guest_team    | host_goals  | guest_goals  |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1          | 10           | 20            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 10            | 2           | 2            |
| 3          | 10           | 50            | 5           | 1            |
| 4          | 20           | 30            | 1           | 0            |
| 5          | 50           | 30            | 1           | 0            |

### Output: 

| team_id    | team_name    | num_points    |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 10         | Leetcode FC  | 7             |
| 20         | NewYork FC   | 3             |
| 50         | Toronto FC   | 3             |
| 30         | Atlanta FC   | 1             |
| 40         | Chicago FC   | 0             |

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT team_id, team_name,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN host_team = team_id AND host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3
             WHEN guest_team = team_id AND guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3
             WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1
             ELSE 0 
        END
    ) AS "num_points"
FROM Teams T1
LEFT JOIN Matches M1
ON M1.host_team = T1.team_id OR M1.guest_team = T1.team_id
GROUP BY team_id, team_name
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1 ASC
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

`Teams` 테이블과 `Matches` 테이블은 서로 `host_team` or `guest_team` 두 가지 컬럼으로 key가 매칭되어야 합니다.  
* `goal` 컬럼을 기준으로 비교해서, 승점을 산정해야하는데, 각각 호스트, 게스트 테이블을 나타내느 ROWS의 정의 되어 있어야 게산이 가능합니다.  

#### STEP.1 [LEFT JOIN 으로 컬럼 늘리기]  

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Teams T1
LEFT JOIN Matches M1
ON M1.host_team = T1.team_id OR M1.guest_team = T1.team_id
```

`LEFT Join`에서의 `Key Point`는 `M1.host_team = T1.team_id, M1.guest_team = T1.team_id` 조건을 OR로 Rows를 늘리는 것 입니다.
| team_id | team_name   | match_id | host_team | guest_team | host_goals | guest_goals |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 10      | Leetcode FC | 3        | 10        | 50         | 5          | 1           |
| 10      | Leetcode FC | 2        | 30        | 10         | 2          | 2           |
| 10      | Leetcode FC | 1        | 10        | 20         | 3          | 0           |
| 20      | NewYork FC  | 4        | 20        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 20      | NewYork FC  | 1        | 10        | 20         | 3          | 0           |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  | 5        | 50        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  | 4        | 20        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  | 2        | 30        | 10         | 2          | 2           |
| 40      | Chicago FC  | null     | null      | null       | null       | null        |
| 50      | Toronto FC  | 5        | 50        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 50      | Toronto FC  | 3        | 10        | 50         | 5          | 1           |  

#### STEP.2 [GROUP BY + SUM(CASE WHEN())]  

```sql
SELECT team_id, team_name,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN host_team = team_id AND host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3
             WHEN guest_team = team_id AND guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3
             WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1
             ELSE 0 
        END
    ) AS "num_points"
FROM Teams T1
LEFT JOIN Matches M1
ON M1.host_team = T1.team_id OR M1.guest_team = T1.team_id
GROUP BY team_id, team_name
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1 ASC
``` 

`left join 한 데이터를 기준으로, `host_team`, `guest_team` 을 기준으로 Group by 한 team_id와 동일하다면, 유니크한 팀의 Rows가 됩니다.  
따라서 CASE WHEN 조건으로 host_team 가 이겼을 경우, guest_team 이겼을 경우, 비겼을 경우의 승점을 더해주면 정답입니다.
