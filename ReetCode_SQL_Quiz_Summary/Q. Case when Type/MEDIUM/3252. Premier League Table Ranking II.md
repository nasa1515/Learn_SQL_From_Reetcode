## [3252. Premier League Table Ranking II]


### Table: TeamStats


| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| team_id          | int     |
| team_name        | varchar |
| matches_played   | int     |
| wins             | int     |
| draws            | int     |
| losses           | int     |

team_id is the unique key for this table.  
This table contains team id, team name, matches_played, wins, draws, and losses.  
Write a solution to calculate the points, position, and tier for each team in the league. Points are calculated as follows:  

* 3 points for a win
* 1 point for a draw
* 0 points for a loss

Note: Teams with the same points must be assigned the same position.  

## Problem

### Tier ranking:

* Divide the league into 3 tiers based on points:
* Tier 1: Top 33% of teams
* Tier 2: Middle 33% of teams
* Tier 3: Bottom 34% of teams
* In case of ties at tier boundaries, place tied teams in the higher tier.
* Return the result table ordered by points in descending, and then by team_name in ascending order.

* The query result format is in the following example.

 

## Example:
