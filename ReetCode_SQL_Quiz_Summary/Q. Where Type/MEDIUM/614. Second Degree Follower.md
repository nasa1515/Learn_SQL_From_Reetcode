## [614. Second Degree Follower]


### Table: Follow


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| followee    | varchar |
| follower    | varchar |

(followee, follower) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.  
Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.  
There will not be a user following themself.  
 
## Problem 

A second-degree follower is a user who:  

* follows at least one user, and
* is followed by at least one user.

Write a solution to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers.  

Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Follow table:


| followee | follower |
|----------|----------|
| Alice    | Bob      |
| Bob      | Cena     |
| Bob      | Donald   |
| Donald   | Edward   |

### Output: 

| follower | num |
|----------|-----|
| Bob      | 2   |
| Donald   | 1   |

### Explanation:   

* User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table.
* User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.
* User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.

GROUP BY 1
order by 1
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

문제 자체를 이해하기가 힘들었는데, 위의 필수 요건을 보고 이해를 했습니다. 문제를 풀기 위한 필수 요건은 다음과 같습니다.  

#### second-degree follower is a user who:

* follows at least one user, and
* is followed by at least one user.

즉, follows and followed 두개의 컬럼에 모두 포함되는 `User`를 찾으면 됩니다.  

1. `SELECT follower FROM follow`로 follow의 테이블의 follower 리스트를 구분해놓은 뒤
2. `followee` 컬럼을 기준으로 Grouping 해서 follower 숫자를 계산하는 쿼리의 where 절에 followee를 포함하는데 사용하면 정답입니다.
