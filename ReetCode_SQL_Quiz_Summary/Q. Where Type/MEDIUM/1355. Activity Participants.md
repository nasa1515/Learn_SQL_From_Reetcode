## [1355. Activity Participants]  


### Table: Friends


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

id is the id of the friend and the primary key for this table in SQL.  
name is the name of the friend.  
activity is the name of the activity which the friend takes part in.  
 

### Table: Activities


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.  
name is the name of the activity.  
 
## Problem 

Find the names of all the activities with neither the maximum nor the minimum number of participants.  
  
Each activity in the Activities table is performed by any person in the table Friends.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Friends table:

| id   | name         | activity      |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | Jonathan D.  | Eating        |
| 2    | Jade W.      | Singing       |
| 3    | Victor J.    | Singing       |
| 4    | Elvis Q.     | Eating        |
| 5    | Daniel A.    | Eating        |
| 6    | Bob B.       | Horse Riding  |

Activities table:

| id   | name         |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | Eating       |
| 2    | Singing      |
| 3    | Horse Riding |

### Output: 

| activity     |
|--------------|
| Singing      |

### Explanation: 

* Eating activity is performed by 3 friends, maximum number of participants, (Jonathan D. , Elvis Q. and Daniel A.)

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS Counter
    FROM Friends
    GROUP BY activity)

SELECT activity
FROM CTE
WHERE Counter != (SELECT MAX(Counter) FROM CTE) and Counter != (SELECT MIN(Counter) FROM CTE)
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

문제를 풀기 위한 조건을 굉장히 간단합니다.  

* 참여자의 최대, 최소 값을 제외한 데이터의 `activity`를 조회합니다.

#### STEP. 1 [GROUP BY Count]

```sql
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS Counter
FROM Friends
GROUP BY activity
```

| activity     | Counter |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Eating       | 3       |
| Singing      | 2       |
| Horse Riding | 1       |  

사실 이제 끝났습니다, Grouping 한 뒤, 구한 개수를 Where 절에서 조합만해서 필터링하면 됩니다.  
방법은 따로 Having 절에서 최대, 최소 값을 제거해도 되고, Rank() 함수를 사용해도 되고 여러가지 입니다.
