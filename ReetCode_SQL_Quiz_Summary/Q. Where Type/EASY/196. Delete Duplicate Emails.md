## Problem Description


### Table: Person

| Column Name | Type    |
|----|----|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 
## Problem
Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 
Person table:

| id | email            |
|----|----|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

### Output: 

| id | email            |
|----|-----|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

#### Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

## 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
DELETE A
FROM Person as A, Person as B
WHERE A.email = B.email and A.id > B.id
```

## 풀이 (Discription)
문제에서 SQL의 경우 Select가 아닌 `Delete` 구문으로 풀라고 조건이 있었습니다.  
따라서, 동일한 테이블을 Self 조인하듯이, 선언 후에, 가작 작은 ID 값을 남기고, 모두 삭제하면, 가장 작은 값만 남게 됩니다.
