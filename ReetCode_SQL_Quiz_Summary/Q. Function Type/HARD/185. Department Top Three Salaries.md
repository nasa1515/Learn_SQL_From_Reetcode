## [185. Department Top Three Salaries]



### Table: Employee


| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.  
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.  
 

### Table: Department


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.  
 
## Problem   

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments.  
A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.  

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Employee table:


| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |

### Department table:


| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

### Output: 

| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

### Explanation: 

In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT E1.name AS Employee,
           E1.salary AS Salary,
           D1.name AS Department,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY D1.name ORDER BY E1.salary DESC) AS SAL_R
    FROM Employee E1
    JOIN Department D1
    ON E1.departmentId = D1.id) AS TEMP
WHERE SAL_R <= 3
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`SubQuery`를 사용해 `salary` 컬럼의 값의 `DENSE_RANK`를 적용한 뒤 값을 필터링해서 데이터를 집계해 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. (Hard 인데 왜 Medium 보다 쉬운거야...?)

1. `departmentId = id`를 Key로 `부서` 데이터를 `Join` 후 `부서 이름`을 기준으로 집계 데이터를 계산합니다.  
2. `DENSE_RANK` 함수로 Join 된 데이터를 `salary` 값을 기준으로 Rank 값을 매긴 뒤, Subquery에서 해당 데이터를 필터링.
 
#### `DENSE_RANK` SQL 

```sql
SELECT E1.name AS Employee,
       E1.salary AS Salary,
       D1.name AS Department,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY D1.name ORDER BY E1.salary DESC) AS SAL_R
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Department D1
ON E1.departmentId = D1.id
```

####  `DENSE_RANK` SQL 결과

| Employee | Salary | Department | SAL_R |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| Max      | 90000  | IT         | 1     |
| Joe      | 85000  | IT         | 2     |
| Randy    | 85000  | IT         | 2     |
| Will     | 70000  | IT         | 3     |
| Janet    | 69000  | IT         | 4     |
| Henry    | 80000  | Sales      | 1     |
| Sam      | 60000  | Sales      | 2     |...

이후 해당 데이터의 `SAL_R` 컬럼을 기준으로 필터링하면 정답입니다.
