### Table: Customers


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |

customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.  
This table contains information about the customers.  
 

### Table: Orders


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| product_id    | int     |

order_id is the column with unique values for this table.  
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.  
There will be no product ordered by the same user more than once in one day.  
 

### Table: Products


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
| price         | int     |

This table contains information about the Products.  
 
## Problem 

Write a solution to find the most recent order(s) of each product.  

Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the product_id in ascending order.  
If there still a tie, order them by order_id in ascending order.  

The result format is in the following example.    

### Example 1:

Input: 

Customers table:

| customer_id | name      |
|-------------|-----------|
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |

Orders table:

| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |
| 3        | 2020-08-29 | 3           | 3          |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 1          |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 2          |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 1          |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 1          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |

Products table:

| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |

### Output: 

| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
|--------------|------------|----------|------------|
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| keyboard     | 1          | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| mouse        | 2          | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |

### Explanation: 

* keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
* mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
* screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
* The hard disk was never ordered and we do not include it in the result table.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT P1.product_name, T1.product_id, T1.order_id, T1.order_date
FROM (
    SELECT O1.order_date, O1.product_id, O1.order_id,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY O1.product_id ORDER BY O1.order_date DESC) AS rank_date
    FROM Orders O1
    JOIN Customers C1
    ON O1.customer_id = C1.customer_id
    ) T1
JOIN Products P1 
ON T1.product_id = P1.product_id
WHERE T1.rank_date = 1
ORDER BY P1.product_name ASC, T1.product_id ASC, T1.order_id ASC
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

문제에 명세되어 있는 조건과 힌트를 찾아서, 아래 로직으로 구현하면 쉽게 정답을 도출할 수 있습니다.  

* 총 테이블은 3개 (Customers, Orders, Products)이고, 각각 `customer_id` , `customer_id`를 Key로 Join 해야 합니다.  
* `product_id` 그룹 별로, 가장 최근 `order_date`를 가진 데이터를 찾아야 합니다.

#### STEP. 1 [JOIN AND RANK()]  

```sql
SELECT O1.order_date, O1.product_id, O1.order_id,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY O1.product_id ORDER BY O1.order_date DESC) AS rank_date
FROM Orders O1
JOIN Customers C1
ON O1.customer_id = C1.customer_id
```  

| order_date | product_id | order_id | rank_date |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2020-08-01 | 1          | 6        | 1         |
| 2020-08-01 | 1          | 7        | 1         |
| 2020-07-31 | 1          | 1        | 3         |
| 2020-07-29 | 1          | 4        | 4         |
| 2020-08-03 | 2          | 8        | 1         |
| 2020-07-30 | 2          | 2        | 2         |
| 2020-07-15 | 2          | 10       | 3         |
| 2020-06-10 | 2          | 5        | 4         |
| 2020-08-29 | 3          | 3        | 1         |
| 2020-08-07 | 3          | 9        | 2         |  

위와 같이, `customer_id`를 기준으로 JOIN 한 뒤, `product_id`를 그룹핑해서, order_date 별로 Rank() 값을 생성합니다.

#### STEP. 2 [JOIN AND Filtering]  

```sql  
SELECT P1.product_name, T1.product_id, T1.order_id, T1.order_date
FROM (
    SELECT O1.order_date, O1.product_id, O1.order_id,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY O1.product_id ORDER BY O1.order_date DESC) AS rank_date
    FROM Orders O1
    JOIN Customers C1
    ON O1.customer_id = C1.customer_id
    ) T1
JOIN Products P1 
ON T1.product_id = P1.product_id
WHERE T1.rank_date = 1
ORDER BY P1.product_name ASC, T1.product_id ASC, T1.order_id ASC
```  

| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| keyboard     | 1          | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| mouse        | 2          | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |

생성한 Rank() 값을 기준으로 가장 높은 값만 필터링 한 뒤, `product_name` 출력을 위한 Join을 수행하면 정답입니다.
