## [534. Game Play Analysis III]

### Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.  
This table shows the activity of players of some games.  
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.  
 
## Problem 

Write a solution to report for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player.  
That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Activity table:


| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

### Output: 

| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |

### Explanation: 

* For the player with id 1, 5 | 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 | 6 | 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
* For the player with id 3, 0 | 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
* Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT player_id, event_date,
       SUM(games_played) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date ASC) as games_played_so_far
FROM Activity
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`Window Sum()` 함수를 사용해 `games_played` 컬럼 값을 Rows 순차 별로 더하도록 하는 로직으로 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `event_date`의 내림차순의 순서로, Player 들의 `games_played` 값의 합의 결과 형태로 데이터를 출력해야 합니다.    
2. 단순하게 `Group by`를 사용하게 되면, 전체 Rows에서 `player_id`를 기준으로 모두 더해진 값이 일괄적으로 나오게 되니, `Window` 함수를 사용해서 하나의 Rows를 `Partition by`로 인식하게 해야 합니다.
