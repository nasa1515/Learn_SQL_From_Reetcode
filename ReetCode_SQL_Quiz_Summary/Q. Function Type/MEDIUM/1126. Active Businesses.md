## [1126. Active Businesses]

### Table: Events


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurrences   | int     | 

(business_id, event_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.  
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.  
The average activity for a particular event_type is the average occurrences across all companies that have this event.  


## Problem 

An active business is a business that has more than one event_type such that their occurrences is strictly greater than the average activity for that event.  

Write a solution to find all active businesses.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input:   

Events table:

| business_id | event_type | occurrences |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 1           | reviews    | 7           |
| 3           | reviews    | 3           |
| 1           | ads        | 11          |
| 2           | ads        | 7           |
| 3           | ads        | 6           |
| 1           | page views | 3           |
| 2           | page views | 12          |

### Output: 

| business_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |

### Explanation:    

* The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
    - 'reviews': (7|3)/2 = 5
    - 'ads': (11|7|6)/3 = 8
    - 'page views': (3|12)/2 = 7.5
* The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT 
    business_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        *,
        AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS avg_occurences
    FROM
        events
) tmp
WHERE occurrences > avg_occurences
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`AVG()`함수를 사용해 `occurrences` 컬럼 값의 평균을 계산한 뒤, 해당 데이터의 조건을 필터링하는 로직으로 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `occurrences` 값이 평균 이상인 데이터를 필터링하기 위해서, 우선적으로 평균 값을 계산해야 합니다.   
2. 이후 계산된 평균 값보다 높은 `occurrences` 값을 찾고, 출력해야 할 `business_id` 그룹핑 후 갯수가 1개 이상인 것만 출력하면 정답입니다.
