## [1831. Maximum Transaction Each Day]


### Table: Transactions


| Column Name    | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| transaction_id | int      |
| day            | datetime |
| amount         | int      |

transaction_id is the column with unique values for this table.  
Each row contains information about one transaction.  
 
## Problem  

Write a solution to report the IDs of the transactions with the maximum amount on their respective day. If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.  

Return the result table ordered by transaction_id in ascending order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Transactions table:

| transaction_id | day                | amount |
|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| 8              | 2021-4-3 15:57:28  | 57     |
| 9              | 2021-4-28 08:47:25 | 21     |
| 1              | 2021-4-29 13:28:30 | 58     |
| 5              | 2021-4-28 16:39:59 | 40     |
| 6              | 2021-4-29 23:39:28 | 58     |

### Output: 

| transaction_id |
|----------------|
| 1              |
| 5              |
| 6              |
| 8              |

### Explanation: 
* "2021-4-3"  --> We have one transaction with ID 8, so we add 8 to the result table.
* "2021-4-28" --> We have two transactions with IDs 5 and 9. The transaction with ID 5 has an amount of 40, while the transaction with ID 9 has an amount of 21. We only include the transaction with ID 5 as it has the maximum amount this day.
* "2021-4-29" --> We have two transactions with IDs 1 and 6. Both transactions have the same amount of 58, so we include both in the result table.
* We order the result table by transaction_id after collecting these IDs.
 

* Follow up: Could you solve it without using the MAX() function?

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT transaction_id
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY day ORDER BY amount DESC) as amount_rk
    FROM Transactions
) T
WHERE amount_rk = 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

문제의 힌트에서, `MAX()` 함수를 쓰지 않고 구현을 하라는 조건을 달아서, 아래와 같이 구현했습니다. 
문제에서 도출되는 힌트들을 종합하면 아래와 같은 조건들을 정리할 수 있습니다.  

* 문제는 동일한 Groupby의`day` (기간) 중에, `amount`가 가장 높은 `transaction_id`을 출력하는 문제 입니다.

#### STEP. 1 [Window - RANK()]

```sql
SELECT *,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY day ORDER BY amount DESC) as amount_rk
FROM Transactions
```

| transaction_id | day        | amount | amount_rk |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| 8              | 2021-04-03 | 57     | 1         |
| 5              | 2021-04-28 | 40     | 1         |
| 9              | 2021-04-28 | 21     | 2         |
| 1              | 2021-04-29 | 58     | 1         |
| 6              | 2021-04-29 | 58     | 1         |  

다음과 같이, `RANK()` 함수를 사용해서, 동일한 Group (`day`)을 기준으로 내림차순 정렬로, ROW의 Rank 데이터를 생성합니다.

#### STEP. 2 [WHERE Filtering]

```sql
SELECT transaction_id
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY day ORDER BY amount DESC) as amount_rk
    FROM Transactions
) T
WHERE amount_rk = 1
ORDER BY 1
```

| transaction_id |
| -------------- |
| 1              |
| 5              |
| 6              |
| 8              |  

`Where` 필터링으로, rank 데이터가 1인 값만 출력하면 정답입니다.
