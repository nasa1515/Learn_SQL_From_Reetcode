## [1308. Running Total for Different Genders]  

### Table: Scores


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| player_name   | varchar |
| gender        | varchar |
| day           | date    |
| score_points  | int     |

(gender, day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.  
A competition is held between the female team and the male team.  
Each row of this table indicates that a player_name and with gender has scored score_point in someday.  
Gender is 'F' if the player is in the female team and 'M' if the player is in the male team.  
 
## Problem 

Write a solution to find the total score for each gender on each day.  

Return the result table ordered by gender and day in ascending order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input:   

Scores table:


| player_name | gender | day        | score_points |
|-------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Aron        | F      | 2020-01-01 | 17           |
| Alice       | F      | 2020-01-07 | 23           |
| Bajrang     | M      | 2020-01-07 | 7            |
| Khali       | M      | 2019-12-25 | 11           |
| Slaman      | M      | 2019-12-30 | 13           |
| Joe         | M      | 2019-12-31 | 3            |
| Jose        | M      | 2019-12-18 | 2            |
| Priya       | F      | 2019-12-31 | 23           |
| Priyanka    | F      | 2019-12-30 | 17           |

### Output: 

| gender | day        | total |
|--------|------------|-------|
| F      | 2019-12-30 | 17    |
| F      | 2019-12-31 | 40    |
| F      | 2020-01-01 | 57    |
| F      | 2020-01-07 | 80    |
| M      | 2019-12-18 | 2     |
| M      | 2019-12-25 | 13    |
| M      | 2019-12-30 | 26    |
| M      | 2019-12-31 | 29    |
| M      | 2020-01-07 | 36    |

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT gender, day,
       SUM(score_points) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY day ASC) AS Total
FROM Scores
ORDER BY gender, day ASC
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)

문제의 조건에 맞는 힌트들을 추론해보면, 아래와 같은 힌트들을 토대로 문제를 풀이 할 수 있습니다.  

* gender 별로 그룹핑 후 score_points의 합산을 구해야한다.  
* score_points 합산의 패턴의 경우, 순차적으로 더해진다.
* 정렬의 경우 gender, day 순으로 오름차순이다.  

#### STEP.1 [PARTITION을 사용하자]  

```sql
SELECT gender, day,
       SUM(score_points) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY day ASC) AS Total
FROM Scores
ORDER BY gender, day ASC
```

| gender | day        | Total |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| F      | 2019-12-30 | 17    |
| F      | 2019-12-31 | 40    |
| F      | 2020-01-01 | 57    |
| F      | 2020-01-07 | 80    |
| M      | 2019-12-18 | 2     |
| M      | 2019-12-25 | 13    |
| M      | 2019-12-30 | 26    |
| M      | 2019-12-31 | 29    |
| M      | 2020-01-07 | 36    |  

따로 어려울게 없는 문제였습니다, 위에 발견한 힌트를 토대로, `Window SUM()`으로 Row 순차의 합을 계산하면 됩니다.
