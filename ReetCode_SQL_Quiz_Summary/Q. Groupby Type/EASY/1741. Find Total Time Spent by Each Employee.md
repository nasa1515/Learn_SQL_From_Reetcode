## [1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee]


### Table: Employees


| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |

(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.  
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.  
event_day is the day at which this event happened  
in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.  
in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.  
It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.  
 
## Problem 

Write a solution to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office.  
Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once.  
The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  
 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Employees table:


| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |

### Output: 

| day        | emp_id | total_time |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |

### Explanation: 

* Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) | (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
* Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT event_day AS day, 
       emp_id,
       SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time
FROM Employees
GROUP BY event_day, emp_id
ORDER BY 1
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`GROUP BY`로 원본 테이블의 컬럼을 기준으로 데이터를 집계해서 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `event_day, emp_id` 두 컬럼의 그룹핑 데이터 중, `out_time`, `in_time` 두 컬럼의 차의 합 데이터를 집계하시오.    
`GROUP BY event_day, emp_id` 이후, `SUM(out_time - in_time) as total_time`로 집계하면 됩니다.
