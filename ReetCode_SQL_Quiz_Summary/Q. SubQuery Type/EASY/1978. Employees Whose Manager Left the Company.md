## [1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company]


### Table: Employees


| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |

In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.  
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager.  
Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 
## Problem 
Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company.  
When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table,  
but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.  

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.  

The result format is in the following example.  
  
 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Employees table:


| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

### Output: 

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |


### Explanation: 

The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).  
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).  
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000 
AND manager_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT(employee_id)
    FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`SUBQuery`을 사용해 `manager_id` 컬럼의 값이 `employee_id`에 포함되지 않는 데이터를 집계해 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `manager_id`에 `employee_id` 데이터가 존재하지 않는 경우에서 `salary`의 값이 `30000` 이하인 값을 집계     
WHERE 절의 `NOT IN`을 사용해서, 각 컬럼의 데이터를 비교 했습니다..
