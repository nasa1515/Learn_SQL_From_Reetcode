## [1789. Primary Department for Each Employee]

### Table: Employee


| Column Name   |  Type   |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |

(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.  
employee_id is the id of the employee.  
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.  
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee.  
If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.  
 
## Problem 
Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments,  
they need to decide which department is their primary department.  
Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.  

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department.  
For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.  

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

 

## Example 1:

### Input: 

Employee table:


| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |

### Output: 

| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

### Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.

## 🟢 답안 (SQL Solution)

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee 
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR employee_id in (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id 
    HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1)
```

## 🟢 풀이 (Discription)
`SubQUERY`로 원본 테이블의 `employee_id` 기준 하나만 존재하는 데이터를 집계해서 해결했습니다.   
문제에서 나온 조건에 따라서, 풀이를 대신하겠습니다. 

1. `primary_flag`가 Y인 경우, `department_id`가 1개만 있는 경우의 데이터를 집계하시오.  
`HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1)`로 한개만 있는 데이터를 집계해놓은 뒤, `WEHER` 절로 필터링했습니다.   
* CASE, WHEN, Window 등으로 풀려고 했으나, 너무 비효율적이고, SUBQUERY가 적합해 보였습니다.
